## Who Am I?

I am a 3/4 Computer Engineering student at Stevens and I am planning to complete a minor in Engineering Management as well. </br>
I aspire to be in the IT, Cybersecurity, and/or Cloud Computing fields. I eventually would love to become a Project Manager for any of these fields.

## Fun Facts

* GitHub will display README.txt as well as the standard README.md
* I play the [drums on this electronic kit](https://www.roland.com/us/products/td-1k/)
* Suzanne Vega's a capella song [Tom's Diner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom%27s_Diner) is known as the "Mother of MP3"
  * MP3 researchers and audio engineers found that some alpha versions of MP3 will compress and distort the song
  * Its clarity allowed the refinement of the MP3 codec
